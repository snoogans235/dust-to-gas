This test is going to assume a uniform converstion factor (1.25 from Sandstrom), and look at the resulting DGR values and make sure they are in the 1e-2 range.

It looks like this might be an opportune moment to run though some constant values and see which values show the least variation with both the tukey method and gaussian method.
