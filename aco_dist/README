Going to pull the data from Sandstrom 2013 table 4 to make a distribution of all of the data in order to see what the aco distribution looks like.  She gives several colums of data, but this will only take the Mean aco and #of measures and then set up some sort of histogram and maybe try to fit a distribution function to it or fill in the gaps.
